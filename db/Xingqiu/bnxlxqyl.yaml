  this team has three objectives beyond the \"normal ones\" like snapshotting pyronado
  in bennett buff and getting as many rainsword procs as possible - you want to cast
  yelan e on cooldown, you want to cast bennett's e on cooldown while he has his buff
  up for the cdr, you want to cast xq near the bottom of yelan's a4, but not at the
  very bottom because you want the expiration of it to give you bennett buff on bennett
  to lower his e cooldown. the sim casts the xingqiu e at that spot to funnel xq with
  yelan. \n\n#the point of this team is to take advantage of bennett's cdr provided
  by his buff to relax ER requirements for the entire party. he casts e enough times
  that crimson witch is actually the play on him over, say, instructors, because the
  users who would benefit from instructors dynamically (yelan and xingqiu) are maintaining
  aura rather than reacting\n\n#elemental reactions: the combination of rainswords
  and yerainswords are enough to easy vape no matter the strength of pyro application
  - the only time you cleanse hydro aura is when gouba/pyronado/bennett e all hit
  at once, and subsequently any auto swing will instantly clean any stray pyro and
  reapply hydro. that makes getting value out of this comp easier than it might seem\n\n#this
  is very poor on 2+ targets - everyone but Xiangling best dps in Teyvat has a single
  target focus\n\n#performance in game will likely exceed performance in sims. both
  xl and xq scale decently well with better artifacts, and sim assumes that you're
  hugging your enemy, so orbitals will make it hard to forward vape both hits of xq's
  e (or even 1 hit, with most rotations). in game, it's very, very easy to do so,
  and incredibly potent. combined with an almost complete lack of ER requirements,
  the weapons you will use in game will likely be a crit weapon, or anything that
  just gives big damage.\n\n#in regards to whalescaling, yelan constellations increase
  her personal damage significantly, but aren't anything drastic. jade cutter (or
  any of mist/jade/haran) will balloon xq's damage to the tune of 15-20%. engulfing
  lightning on xl, or homa + er sands, will both make xl's pyronado ticks effectively
  go up in damage by ~30-40%, which approaches the point of hilarity. the largest
  gain on this team, however, is mistsplitter on bennett. the number of e casts, combined
  with the highest base attack in the game makes it the premiere choice for this team.
  freedom sworn, while not as numerically monolithic, is almost as good. elegy on
  yelan is, similarly, worth considering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
