  attack, skill, dash, attack:3;\n#at the very end of yelan's a4, you're going to
  use xingqiu's skill and swing until you proc your final rainswords, xq catches his
  own particles\n\nbennett attack, skill, attack:2;\nxiangling attack;\n#funnel xl
  one time - not necessary but helps with ER constraints. xl can survive with no er
  + the catch and emblem, but this gives you something to do to keep yourself from
  yolo swap bursting on xq - remember it's a 21s rotation, not 20s\n\nrestart;\n\n#put
  conceptually, this team has three objectives beyond the \"normal ones\" like snapshotting
  pyronado in bennett buff and getting as many rainsword procs as possible - you want
  to cast yelan e on cooldown, you want to cast bennett's e on cooldown while he has
  his buff up for the cdr, you want to cast xq at the bottom of yelan's a4. the sim
  does not forward vape the hit but you can try to forward vape at least one of the
  two hits.\n\n#the point of this team is to take advantage of bennett's cdr provided
  by his buff to relax ER requirements for the entire party. he casts e enough times
  that crimson witch is actually the play on him over, say, instructors, because the
  users who would benefit from instructors dynamically (yelan and xingqiu) are maintaining
  aura rather than reacting\n\n#elemental reactions: the combination of rainswords
  and yerainswords are enough to easy vape no matter the strength of pyro application
  - the only time you cleanse hydro aura is when gouba/pyronado/bennett e all hit
  at once, and subsequently any auto swing will instantly clean any stray pyro and
  reapply hydro. that makes getting value out of this comp easier than it might seem\n\n#this
  is very poor on 2+ targets - everyone but xiangling has a single target focus\n\n#performance
  in game will likely exceed performance in sims. both xl and xq scale decently well
  with better artifacts, and sim assumes that you're hugging your enemy, so orbitals
  will kill any chance of forward vaping xingqiu's e. in game, it's very, very easy
  to do so, and incredibly potent. combined with an almost complete lack of ER requirements,
  the weapons you will use in game will likely be a crit weapon, or anything that
  just gives big damage.\n\n#in regards to whalescaling, yelan constellations increase
  her personal damage significantly, but aren't anything drastic. jade cutter (or
  any of mist/jade/haran) will balloon xq's damage to the tune of 15-20%. engulfing
  lightning on xl, or homa + er sands, will both make xl's pyronado ticks effectively
  go up in damage by ~30-40%, which approaches the point of hilarity. the largest
  gain on this team, however, is mistsplitter on bennett. the number of e casts, combined
  with the highest base attack in the game makes it the premiere choice for this team.
  freedom sworn, while not as numerically monolithic, is almost as good. elegy on
  yelan is, similarly, worth considering.\n\n"
